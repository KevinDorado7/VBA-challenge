This project's codebase has been enhanced with the help of several resources including the AskBCS learning assistant, office hours, and OpenAI's chatGPT. These tools were instrumental in refining the code to ensure it runs seamlessly across multiple worksheets simultaneously and in applying specific formatting to the columns for improved readability and functionality.
